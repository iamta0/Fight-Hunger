                        The empowerment model of the FIGHT HUNGER NIGERIA project forms a central pillar of the initiative. It focuses on equipping communities with the tools, skills, and resources necessary to become self-sufficient, improve their livelihoods, and sustainably address hunger. By focusing on education and access to resources, the program ensures that people are not only surviving hunger but are also empowered to overcome it in the long run. This approach fosters resilience, builds stronger communities, and leads to lasting changes that can transform Nigeria's food security landscape.

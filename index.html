                        sufficient, safe, and nutritious food towards ending poverty, promoting health and fostering

                        to become self-sufficient, improve their livelihoods, and sustainably address hunger. By
                        focusing on education and access to resources, the program ensures that people are not only
                        surviving hunger but are also empowered to overcome it in the long run. This approach fosters
                        resilience, builds stronger communities, and leads to lasting changes that can transform
